# CV1800B
## Introduction of CV1800B
CV1800B is a high-performance, low-power chip for residential consumer surveillance IP cameras, home intelligence and many other products, integrated with H.264/H.265 video compression encoder and ISP; supports digital broad dynamic, 3D noise reduction, defogging, lens distortion correction and other image enhancement and correction algorithms, providing customers with professional-grade video image quality.   

The chip integrates self-developed intelligent reference solutions (human detection, area detection, motion detection), built-in DDR and complete peripherals and peripherals, providing a highly integrated and simple solution to support customer product development and mass production.   

In addition, it also provides secure boot, secure update, secure encryption, etc., providing users with a series of security solutions from development, mass production, and product application with an 8-bit MCU subsystem integrated into the chip, which can replace the general external MCU to achieve the purpose of saving BOM cost and power consumption.
